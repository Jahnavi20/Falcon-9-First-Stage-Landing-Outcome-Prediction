# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
## Introduction

* The goal of this capstone is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 
* SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
* Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

* As a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and I followed the Data Science methodology such as 
  1.Data collection
  2.Data wrangling
  3.Exploratory data analysis
  4.Data visualization
  5.Model development
  6.Model evaluation
  7.Reporting your results to stakeholders.
